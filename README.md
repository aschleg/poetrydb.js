## About PoetryDB

[PoetryDB](http://poetrydb.org/index.html) was created and is currently maintained by 
[@thundercomb](https://twitter.com/thundercomb). They blog about poetry and related technology and 
other topics at [thecombedthunderclap.blogspot.com](http://thecombedthunderclap.blogspot.com/).

Please note, I am in no way affiliated with the creator of PoetryDB. My intention with `poetryDB.js` is to 
help spread awareness of `PoetryDB` and hopefully increase interest in poetry and related projects that attempt to 
create comprehensive databases of publicly available knowledge.
